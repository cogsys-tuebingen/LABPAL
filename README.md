The LABPAL refrence implementation is located at 'source/optimizer/lab_pal.py'.
Note that a closure provided by the method 'get_closure()' of the 'LabPal' class is needed for the 'step' method.

### How to run the example code:
- adapt the dataset path in 'configuration_lab_pal.txt'
- adapt hyper parameters in 'configuration_lab_pal.txt'
- run main.py
